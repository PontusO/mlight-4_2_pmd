// REVISION HISTORY :
//
// 2009-04-12   Pontus Oldberg
//  Imported i2c.c and i2c.h into the pmd project and started conversion
//  to follow invector architecture.
//
// 2005-04-27   Pontus Oldberg
//   Created a new version from the original Silabs application note to fit
//   the IP Avenger. First try. Original comments left in here.
//   This first version was very nastily converted to support only 1 byte
//   address transfers. Should be improved to be more flexible.
//
//
// Example code for interfacing a C8051F0xx to three EEPROMs via the SMBus.
// Code assumes that three 16-bit address space EEPROMs are connected
// on the SCL and SDA lines, and configured so that their slave addresses
// are as follows:
// CHIP_A = 1010000
// CHIP_B = 1010001
// CHIP_C = 1010010
//
// Slave and arbitration states are not defined.  Assume the CF000 is the only
// master in the system.
// Functions: SM_Send performs a 1-byte write to the specified EEPROM
// SM_Receive performs a 1-byte read of the specified EEPROM address (both include
// memory address references).
//
// Includes test code section.
