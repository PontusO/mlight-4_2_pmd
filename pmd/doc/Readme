1     PMD Design Notes

1.1   General information
      This document holds design releated information regarding the PMD product

2     Resource Allocations

2.1   Timers

2.1.1 Timer 0
      Used to generate the time base for the TCP/IP stack

2.1.2 Timer 1
      Used to detect a remote control bit timeout.

2.1.3 Timer 2
      By UART0 in debug mode to generate the baud rate.

2.1.4 Timer 3
      Is used to generate a time base for the real time clock.

2.1.5 Timer 4
      Used to generate tones on the piezo buzzer

2.2   UARTs
      The product can be put into debug mode, overiding the SMBus interface with a UART1_VECTOR
      to allow debug prints.

2.3   SMBus

2.3.1 SMBus 0
      Used in this project to communicate with an external EEPROM and in the future
      it can be used to extend the product.

2.4   SPI
      Not used in this product

2.5   ADC2
      No analog inputs using ADC2 are required in this product

2.6   ADC0
      No analog inputs using ADC0 are required in this product although ADC0.0 -
      ADC0.6 are routed on the mother board PCB to the extension connector.

2.7   DAC
      No analog outputs are used in this product

2.8   Comparators
      On comparator (CP1) is used to detect a push button, CP0 is not used.

2.9   Voltage reference.
      The voltage reference is used to feed the VREF input just in case the analog
      extension signals are ever used. It is also used to feed comparator CP1
      to give a reference level for the comparator.

2.10  PCA
      The PCA is used to measure the input from the infrared remote sensor block.
      CEX0 is connected to pin P0.2 which in turn is connected to the ir sensor on
      the base board. The idea behind this is that the detection algorithm will
      calculate the difference between up and down events on the pin and match that
      towards a known reference stored in the FLASH memory.
