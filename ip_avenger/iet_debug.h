 * Debug macros
 *
 * This file contains usefull debug macros for debuging via printf statements.
 * Two levels of debug prints are available: A_ and B_. A_ should be used for
 * information to the user and B_ should be used when reporting an error.
 *
 * To enable the macro's define either the PRINT_A flag, the PRINT_B flag or
 * both to enable both levels of debug output.
