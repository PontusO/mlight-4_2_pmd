/**
 *********  General *********
 *
 * This module handles the three defined type of instances in the
 * event system. The types are:
 *  - EVENT_EVENT_PROVIDER, Which is the part of the system that
 *      generates the actual event.
 *  - EVENT_ACTION_MANAGER, Is the manager that performs an action.
 *  - EVENT_RULE, Is the handle that connects events to action managers.
 *
 * Event providers and action managers are static parts of the system
 * and are registered with the event system at system startup. Typically
 * done by the pthread before starting the main loop.
 * Rules are the dynamic part. The table that holds the rules is located
 * in flash memory so that changes to to it is always remembered.
 *
 *********  Event Provider *********
 *
 * Event providers are used to generate a specific event. For instance
 * an event provider could be made to listen to a specific sequence of
 * characters on a serial line. And when detected it can send the event
 * to the event system. The event switch will match the incoming event
 * to all registered rules in the system and if it founds a match it will
 * call the trigger function of the action manager.
 *
 *
 ********* Action Managers *********
 *
 * Action managers reacts to triggers sent from the event switch and
 * then performs a specific action. For instance in a larm system
 * it can turn on a sirene and/or possibly call an alarm number to
 * inform the police that a burglery is ongoing etc.
 *
 *
 *********  Rules (Routes) *********
 *
 * Rules, some times refered to as routes, define what shall happen when
 * an event provider has sent an event to the event switch. It basically
 * holds information on what action manager that should be called when
 * a specified event sends an event. For instance if an instance registers
 * a rule with event provider 0 and action manager 1, every time that
 * event provider 0 sends an event to the event switch it will send a
 * trigger event to the action manager that can proceed to do its
 * specific task
 *
 * In order to parameterize the action managers, every rule also hold
 * a pointer to a data area which holds information on how the action
 * manager should operate. This pointer is passed on to the action
 * manager, to provide it with the data. This pointer could be set to
 * point to predefined data in flash memory or to data defined in
 * ram making it more dynamic. Predefined const data obviuosly does
 * not need to be configure but data in ram does. To do that the event
 * switch can be instructed to call (Callback) the event provider to
 * fill the data structure with the appropriate data.
